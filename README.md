|Pipeline|Application|

## Prerequisites
- Anaconda or Miniconda
- Docker (for Docker deployment)

## ‚öíÔ∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11
- Python libraries
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üìù Usage

### Running without Docker

1. **Clone the repository and navigate to directory**
    ```bash
    git pull https://github.com/LudovicGardy/app_sotisimmo
    cd sotisimmo_repos/app_folder
    ```

2. **Environment setup**
    - Create and/or activate the virtual environment:
        ```bash
        conda create -n myenv python=3.11
        conda activate myenv
        ```
        or
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

3. **Start the ETL Process**
    - Run the Python script:
        ```bash
        python main.py
        ```

4. **Configuration**
    - Using `modules/config.py`, configure the scraping parameters:
        - Year (e.g., `2023`)
        - [Optional] Department (default: `1`)

    - Example: Selecting `2023` and `1` will iterate over all departments (from 1 to 914) for the year 2023.

5. **Process**
    - Iterates over each department (1 to 95) from `onset_date` to `offset_date`.
    - Fetches and parses online data for offers.
    - Cleans, normalizes, and stores data in the SQL database.

### Running with Docker

1. **Prepare Docker environment**
    - Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.

2. **Navigate to project directory**
    - For multiple containers:
        ```bash
        cd [path-to-app-folder-containing-docker-compose.yml]
        ```
    - For a single container:
        ```bash
        cd [path-to-app-folder-containing-Dockerfile]
        ```

3. **Build and start the containers**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    - The application will be accessible at `localhost:8501`.

    - ‚ö†Ô∏è If you encounter issues with `pymssql`, adjust its version in `requirements.txt` or remove it before building the Docker image.
